            <p>I am Sophia,
                For those who don't know me- I’m a wife, a mother of six grown children and many grandchildren.
                I was born into as large family in Russia, where my parents kept fighting to keep our Jewish faith
                alive in
                Communist Era.
                Eventually , we were able to escape to Israel
                where I got married and moved to the USA.

                In my early years I was a teacher and educator at different Jewish schools .
                Throughout my teaching career , I noticed how we put so much emphasis on our Faith and studies, and
                often
                neglect to take care of our health and nutrition .
                I also noticed health issues arising from weight gain and health disorders , I decided to start
                researching
                and hearing different natural ways, that I can make an impact on my community.

                I took him home ... against medical advice ..and started feeding him the micronutrients.

                And only after three days he went from non-responsive to moving his head and arm- I saw light at the
                end of
                the tunnel !
                Long story short- he was eating solid food within three weeks!

                My Goals,
                My goal is simple and bold !
                Together with my team - I want to help change the nutritional habits and impact my community to live
                healthy , active lifestyle.

                It’s my passion and commitment, to help everyone I can to get healthier and I go beyond the
                expectations to
                get the job done. </p>
